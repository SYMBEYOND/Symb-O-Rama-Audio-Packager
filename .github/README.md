# Symb-O-Rama Audio Packager

A minimal, privacy-respecting tool for sequencing creators and holiday lighting enthusiasts.

---

## What It Does

Load a legally owned MP3/WAV — or paste a legally owned YouTube link — and the app automatically generates everything needed for sequencing.

No configuration. No command-line steps. No setup.

**Input → Process → Done.**

---

## What It Outputs

Each processed song creates a folder on your Desktop containing:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `{songname}_original.mp3` | Your original audio preserved |
| `{songname}_Symb.wav` | Clean mono WAV (44.1 kHz) optimized for sequencing |
| `{songname}_Symb_Timings.txt` | Timing grid for sequencing workflows |
| `{songname}_Symb_StarTimings.xml` | Star Timings XML |
| `README_{songname}_Symb.md` | Metadata and reference notes |

The folder name matches the song title, so everything stays organized.

## Privacy

Everything is processed locally.

- Nothing is uploaded
- Nothing is tracked
- Nothing is stored remotely

You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to the music you process — not because a warning demands it, but because **respecting creators matters**.

---

## Roadmap

Future features being explored:

- Batch processing
- Alternative timing algorithms
- Direct export for more sequencing apps
- Waveform visualization
- Plugin-style extensions
