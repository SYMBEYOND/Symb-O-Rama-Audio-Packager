🚦 NEW RELEASE:

Symb-O-Rama Audio Packager v1.1.1

A lightweight, cross-platform tool for sequencing creators and holiday lighting enthusiasts.

---

🎯 What It Does

---

This app takes either:

• A legally owned YouTube link

• OR a legally owned local MP3/WAV file

And automatically generates a clean, sequencing-ready audio package.

No configuration. No command-line steps. No setup.

---

📦 What It Outputs:

Each processed song creates a folder on your Desktop containing:

• A normalized 44.1 kHz mono WAV

• The original MP3 preserved

• A timing grid file

• A Superstar-compatible XML timing map

• A README with metadata and notes

The folder name matches the song title, so everything stays organized.

---

🧠 Why It Exists:

Anyone who sequences holiday lights knows:

Getting clean audio + usable timing tracks is the first brick wall.

This removes that frustration — and replaces it with a single workflow:

Input → Process → Done.

---

🖥 Supported Platforms:

• macOS (Apple Silicon) — supported now

• Windows — supported

• Linux (AppImage + .deb) — supported

• macOS Intel — planned

No Python install required. No FFmpeg setup. It’s bundled.

---

🔒 Privacy & Ownership

---

Everything is processed locally.

Nothing is uploaded. Nothing is tracked.

Users are responsible for ensuring they have the rights to the music they process.

Not because a warning demands it — but because respecting creators matters.

---

🚧 Roadmap

---

Future features being explored include:

• Batch processing

• Alternative timing algorithms

• Direct export for more sequencing apps

• Plugin-style extensions

🧾 License:

MIT license with one added principle:

“Software built for a creative community should never become exploitative.”

If this tool helps you — consider sharing it with another creator in the holiday lighting community.

Sequencing should feel creative, not painful.
